A Witten Analysis of our Stock Analysis Results

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    The purpose of this analysis is to figure out how DQ & the rest of our green stocks we were provided did in comparison to one other. Steve's parents were interested in investing in DQ, so we needed to see just how well the stocks' returns were for 2017 & 2018.

### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
    2017 was a much stronger year for green stocks than 2018. In 2017, only one stock, TERP, had a negative return in investment, which was only -7.2%. DQ had the largest return with a whopping 199.4%. Surprisingly, it had the lowest total daily volume amount for the year among the rest of the green stocks.

    On the other hand, 2018 was overall a rough year for green stocks. Only ENPH & RUN had a positive return for the year. DQ had the biggest loss on the stocks' return at -62.6%. It seems like it had quite a rebound after the tremondous return it had the previous year.

### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
    1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
    A big advantage to refactoring code is making the code look cleaner and easier to read for someone looking at your code. Another advantage is the code running mich quicker. In additon being able to identify any bugs or issues that arise will be much easier because of the length of the code. A disadvantage code be that someone unfamiliar with for loops & nested loops would have a hard time creating refactored code. 
    2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
    My refactored code looks a lot cleaner. I honestly don't think it looks too much shorter, but with practice it did look better.
